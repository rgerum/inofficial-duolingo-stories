An important part of learning with Duostories is to have the
translation of a word in the story directly available. Therefore, when translation
the story you also need to provide translation hints.

The system works as follows: you write the sentence in one line and the translation below:

```
[LINE]
> Jan is thuis met  zijn vrouw, Marian.
~ ~   is home  with his  wife   ~
```

The sentence will be split into words and each word will be matched with the word on the sentence below.
If a word is translated with "~", no translation will be displayed for the word.
This is used for names where there is not need for a translation.

<Info>The syntax highlighting will highlight words alternating in blue and green to help you see
how it will perform the mapping.</Info>

### Joining Words
Sometimes translations are more complicated than a one to one match of words.

```
[LINE]
Speaker292: Weet~jij    waar mijn lesboek Engels is?
~           do~you~know Where  my textbook English is
```

Here you can "glue" words together using the tilde sign `~`. They are treated as one word for
the sake of translation. So *"Weet jij"* will have the joined hint *"do you know"*.

Words in the target language as well as the translation can be joined to create one to many, many to one,
or many to many mappings.

### Splitting Words
Sometimes languages do not separate words with spaces. A prominent example here is chinese script.

```
[LINE]
Speaker560: 我的|钥匙|在哪里？
~           my  keys (are)~where
```
Here you can use the vertical bar `|` (also known as pipe). Its the opposite of the title and splits words
for the translation hints while it still appears without spaces in the final story.

### Show Hints

With a click on the ![hints](/docs/story-editing/hints_button.png "Hints") button you can show the hints displayed
directly below each word. Especially when reviewing stories this is a great tool.
