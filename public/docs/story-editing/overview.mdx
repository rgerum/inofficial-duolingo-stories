Duostories is not like the software *Word* where you edit the final output directly, but you write
the stories in some kind of "coding" language that will be converted to the final story display.

This sounds complicated but in practice is easy to use and helps to see what is going on exactly.

### Editor
The editor has two panels, on the left you can see the code that you can edit and on the
right you see how the story will look like. Both views are synchronized when scrolling so that
you have always the matching view.

### Comments
```
# This line is a comment
```
Sometimes it can be helpful to leave comments in the code. For example
if you want to mark a translation where you want to consult another contributor.

You can mark a line with the hash sign `#` to mark it as a comment that should not
appear in the final story.

### Save
You can save a story with a click on the ![save](/docs/story-editing/save_button.png "save") symbol. Changes
to stories are tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/rgerum/unofficial-duolingo-stories-content).

### Meta data
```
[DATA]
fromLanguageName=A Family Dinner
icon=076bc5bf725308c211b9c04f07d3622683e84d78
set=8|4
```

On the top of the story there is some meta data that defines the name
as it is shown in the story list, the icon that the story uses and the set.
The set number is composed o the set id (e.g. Set 8) and the position within the set, the set index (e.g. the 4th story
of the set).

<Warning>In some legacy stories you still see some character icon or speaker definitions here.
They are only for compatibility with old stories and should not be used in new story translations.</Warning>
