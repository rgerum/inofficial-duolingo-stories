description: "Change the audio generation with replacement rules."
---

Sometimes the generated audio does not fit how you want the word or sentence to sound. Or maybe you want to
use a voice form a different language if your language does not have voices. Therefore, you can adjust the
text that is send to the Speech Engine.

In the TTS Editor you can define rules to change the text before it is
send to the TTS service. There are three types of rules. Letter replacements, Fragment replacements
and Word replacements.

To open it click on the Edit button in the top right corner of the character editor:

### Letter Replacements

Letter replacements are defined by a list of letters followed by a colon and a replacement string.
They are always replaced in the given order. On the left side of the colon there can only be one letter.
```
LETTERS:
    o: u
    e: i
```

### Fragment Replacements
Fragment replacements can be used to change syllables in a word. If the fragment ends in \b it only replaces words that
end in the fragment. If the fragment starts with \b the fragment has to be at the beginning of the word.
```
FRAGMENTS:
    ion\b: flug
    sem: dem
```

### Word replacements
To replace whole words. A word will only be replaced with it is surrounded by white space or punctuation characters, e.g.
not if it is found within another word.
```
WORDS:
    oh: uuuh
    Worcester: WOO-STER
```
If you want to provide the word in the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) instead,
you can write after the word `:ipa`.
