To make the Duostories more engaging we use audio for the text in the stories.
This audio is machine generated using text-to-speech (TTS) engines.

If you have translated a story and want to add audio, you first need to assign voices to the
characters in the story using the "Character Editor" if they do not already have voices. Then you
can generate each audio line separately, see "Generate Audio".
